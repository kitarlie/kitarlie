Charlie is my name, and space physics is my game ðŸ˜Ž

I'm a third-year Physics student at Lancaster University. I've been coding in Python for nearly 7 years, focusing mainly on mathematical modelling, simulations, and data visualisation. I'm currently working on a research project invesigating the Jovian magnetosphere and its response to Io's volcanism; to do this, I'm learning how to use Astropy to extract data from large FITS files.
