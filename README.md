Charlie is my name, and space physics is my game ðŸ˜Ž

I'm a third-year Physics student at Lancaster University. I've been coding in Python for nearly 7 years, focusing mainly on mathematical modelling, simulations, and data visualisation. I'm currently working on a research project invesigating the Jovian magnetosphere and its response to Io's volcanism; to do this, I'm learning how to use Astropy to extract data from large FITS files, provided by the Hisaki mission ðŸ”­

I'm currently learning Swedish; I also love music - I play piano, guitar, bass and drums - as well as bouldering and hiking. If you want to reach out, you can find me at charliepf.04@gmail.com ðŸ«¡
