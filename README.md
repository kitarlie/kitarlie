Charlie is my name, and space physics is my game ðŸ˜Ž

I'm a third-year Physics student at Lancaster University. I've been coding in since 2018, focusing mainly on mathematical modelling, simulations, and data visualisation. I'm currently working on [Ringmind[(http://ringmind.org), an interdisciplinary project showing the self-organising power of planetary ring structures and how they relate to human thinking and unconventional computing. We are migrating the codebase from Processing to C++, to introduce a novel method of GPU-based physical simulation; the improved efficiency will allow us to present a system of collisional, self-gravitating particles that eventually forms a ring system.

I'm currently learning Swedish; I also love music - I play piano, guitar, bass and drums - as well as bouldering and hiking. If you want to reach out, you can find me at charliepf.04@gmail.com ðŸ«¡
